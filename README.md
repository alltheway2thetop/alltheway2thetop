- 👋 Hi, I’m @alltheway2thetop
- 👀 I’m interested in writing code and createing web and mobile apps. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more html, css, javascript, I've also been learning about jsx. 
  Ive been researching API's and how to write them. But I thought if I could put the word out 
  To get some help with experience it would speed up the process. Or at least git a little guidance. 
  This is my first build but I'm determined to do this. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a communications app. 
- 📫 How to reach me, bryant669@outlook.com.
